abstract = {The edge clique cover (ecc ) problem deals with discovering a set of (possibly overlapping) cliques in a given graph that covers each of the graph's edges. This problem finds applications ranging from social networks to compiler optimization and stringology. We consider several variants of the ecc problem, using classical quality measures (like the number of cliques) and new ones. We describe efficient heuristic algorithms, the fastest one taking O(mdG) time for a graph with m edges, degeneracy dG (also known as k-core number). For large real-world networks with millions of nodes, like social networks, an algorithm should have (almost) linear running time to be practical: Our algorithm for finding eccs of large networks has linear-time performance in practice because dG is small, as our experiments show, on real-world networks with thousands to several million nodes.}
